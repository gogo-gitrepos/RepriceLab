You are working on my RepriceLab.com app in this Replit project.

I need three production changes:

------------------------------------------------
1) Update login email placeholder/domain
------------------------------------------------
Goal: Change every occurrence of the demo email `john@repricer.com` to `john@repricerlab.com` on the login/signup UI.

Requirements:
- On the main login screen, change the email input placeholder and any pre-filled demo value from `john@repricer.com` to `john@repricerlab.com`.
- Search the codebase for:
  - `john@repricer.com`
  - `repricer.com`
and replace with the new domain ONLY where it is used as a demo/sample user email for this app (login form, signup form, help text, seeds, etc.).
- Do NOT break any email validation logic; the new email must still pass all validations.

------------------------------------------------
2) Clear demo/sample data on Dashboard for new users
------------------------------------------------
Right now the Dashboard shows static example data (e.g. “84% Profitable”, “68,724 events”, “Top Competitors” list, etc.) even for a brand new account.

I want the Dashboard to have a proper **empty state** until the user connects their marketplace (Amazon / channels), e.g. until some “account is connected / has data” flag is true.

Requirements:
- Inspect how the dashboard data is currently populated (mock JSON, hard-coded constants, or API responses).
- Introduce or reuse a clear flag such as `hasConnectedMarketplace`, `hasSalesData`, or similar.
  - If such a flag already exists in the backend/frontend, use it.
  - If not, create a minimal placeholder flag in the frontend for now (e.g. assume `false` by default for new users) and structure the code so it can later be wired to the real backend.
- When there is **no connected marketplace / no data**:
  - All top KPIs (Spent this period, Daily limit remaining, Safe Mode banner, profitability percentage, buy box rate, activity totals, competitors, etc.) should show either:
    - 0 values, or
    - a clear “No data yet” / “Connect your marketplace to see data” empty state.
  - Remove or hide fake numbers like 84%, 68,724, 8.4K products, competitor list, etc.
  - Use consistent empty state text across widgets, for example:
    - “No data available yet. Connect your Amazon account to start seeing insights.”
- When there **is data / marketplace connected** (flag true):
  - Existing graphs and cards should display real data coming from the backend API (or the current mocked pipeline), not static constants.

Please refactor the dashboard components so that this “no data vs has data” logic is clean and easy to extend.

------------------------------------------------
3) Disable demo login – require real sign-up for access
------------------------------------------------
We are now in production. Users must NOT be able to log in with any random email/password. Only registered accounts should be allowed.

Requirements:
- Inspect the current authentication implementation:
  - If there is already a proper auth backend (database, JWT, etc.), make sure the login form calls it and validates credentials instead of accepting any values.
  - If there is a temporary or demo auth that lets any email/password in, **remove that behavior**.
- Enforce the following behavior:
  - A user can log in ONLY if:
    - they have previously registered via the signup flow, OR
    - they exist in the backend user store.
  - Invalid email/password combinations must return an error and stay on the login page.
- If there is no signup flow at all, create a minimal but secure email/password registration:
  - Store passwords hashed (e.g. bcrypt or similar).
  - Validate email format.
  - Show proper error messages on duplicate emails, weak passwords, etc.
- Protect the dashboard and all authenticated routes with proper route guards:
  - If a user is not authenticated, they should be redirected to the login page.
- Keep a configuration or environment flag for future:
  - e.g. `DEMO_MODE=true/false`
  - When `DEMO_MODE=false` (production), demo login should be completely disabled (current requirement).
  - If you introduce this flag, default it to `false` in this project.

------------------------------------------------
4) Housekeeping
------------------------------------------------
- Run existing tests and ensure no build errors.
- If necessary, add or update basic tests:
  - Login fails with invalid credentials.
  - Dashboard empty state is shown when there is no data.
- Briefly document in README or a short comment:
  - where the login logic lives,
  - how the “has data vs no data” flag works on the dashboard.

Once you finish, summarize:
- Which files you changed,
- How to test:
  - login behavior,
  - dashboard empty state,
  - and where the placeholder email was updated.
