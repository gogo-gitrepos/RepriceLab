We already have a basic automation framework in this RepriceLab.com project.

Now I want you to DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT detailed **UI/E2E test cases** for the **Dashboard page and the entire left side menu**.

Use Playwright + Page Object Model (or the existing stack in this repo) and add tests under the appropriate folder (e.g. `tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` and `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`).

### 1. Page Objects

Create/extend Page Objects for:

- `DashboardPage`
- `SideMenu` (left navigation)
- Any sub-pages that are opened from the side menu (Products, Multichannel, Repricing Rules, Automations, Import, Orders, Repricing Activity, Competitors, Reports, Settings, App Store, etc.)

Expose locators + helper methods like `goToDashboard()`, `openProducts()`, `openRepricingRules()`, `openSettings()`, etc.

### 2. Dashboard main use cases

Create automated tests for at least the following scenarios. Use **data-independent assertions** where possible (texts, titles, presence of components, etc.).

**D1 – Dashboard loads successfully**
- Open `/dashboard` (or the route used after login).
- Verify:
  - Page title and main heading (e.g. “Dashboard”).
  - Safe Mode banner appears with correct text when account is in Safe Mode.
  - No unhandled console errors.

**D2 – KPI cards are visible**
- Verify the 3 top cards render:
  - “$0.00 Spent this period”
  - “$0.00 Daily limit remaining”
  - “Need Help?” card with its title and description.
- Assert that each card has the expected icon and basic layout.

**D3 – Need Help card actions**
- On the “Need Help?” section:
  - Verify “Send us an email” button/link is visible and clickable.
  - Verify “Schedule a call” button/link is visible and clickable.
  - Assert that click opens the correct URL or triggers the expected navigation/modal.

**D4 – Sales data widget**
- Verify the “Sales data unavailable for this period” block is shown.
- Click **Settings** on this widget and assert:
  - A settings panel/modal opens OR the user is navigated to the correct settings page.
  - Close the panel/modal and assert dashboard is still usable.

**D5 – Insights + Profitability section**
- Verify “Insights” card with category list (Category A–E) is visible.
- Assert that each category row shows:
  - Category name
  - Percentage text (e.g. “75%”)
  - Progress bar element.
- Verify “Profitability” card is visible with:
  - Main percentage (e.g. “84% Profitable”)
  - Supporting text below.

**D6 – Repricing Insights + Activity History + Buy Box Ownership**
- Verify “Repricing Insights” card is visible with at least:
  - Optimized listings
  - Repricing listings
  - Underpriced listings
  - Buy box loss listings
  - Latest price listings
- Assert the numeric values and “of X” labels are rendered.
- Verify “Activity History” card and its total pricing events text.
- Verify “Buy Box Ownership” card:
  - Shows ring chart with percentage (e.g. “60%”)
  - Shows description text (e.g. “Current Buy Box Rate…”).

**D7 – Top Competitors block**
- Verify the “Top Competitors” section lists at least 5 competitors.
- Check ranking numbers (1–5), competitor names and progress bar percentages.
- Click “View All Competitors” and assert:
  - User is navigated to the Competitors page OR a full list view.
  - URL or route is correct.

**D8 – Responsiveness/basic layout smoke**
- At least one test that resizes viewport (desktop → smaller width) and verifies:
  - Dashboard main elements still render (no critical overlaps).
  - Left menu can still be used (visible or collapsible, depending on app behavior).

### 3. Left side menu navigation use cases

Implement a dedicated test file (e.g. `navigation.spec.ts`) that focuses on the **entire left sidebar**.

Assume the following entries, adapt to real labels in code:

- Dashboard
- Products
- Multichannel
- Repricing Rules
- Automations
- Import
- Orders
- Repricing Activity
- Competitors
- Reports
- Settings
- App Store

Create tests for:

**N1 – Menu renders correctly**
- After login, verify all menu items above are visible with their icons and labels.
- Assert the current page (Dashboard) is highlighted/active.

**N2 – Navigation works for each menu item**
For EACH menu item:
- Click the menu item.
- Assert:
  - URL/route changes correctly (e.g. `/products`, `/repricing-rules`, etc.).
  - The related page shows its main heading (e.g. “Products”, “Repricing Rules”).
  - The selected menu item is highlighted as active.
- Make these as parameterized tests / data-driven where possible to avoid duplication.

**N3 – Return to Dashboard from any page**
- Navigate to a non-dashboard page.
- Click “Dashboard” in the side menu.
- Assert user is back on the dashboard, with widgets visible and Dashboard active.

**N4 – Menu hover / focus states (optional)**
- Check that menu items visually react to hover/focus (if easily assertable via CSS classes).

**N5 – Menu collapsible behavior (if implemented)**
- If there is a collapse/expand control for the side menu:
  - Collapse the menu and verify icons remain, text hides.
  - Expand again and verify labels return.

### 4. Implementation details

- Reuse existing login helper to authenticate once per test file (or in `beforeAll`).
- Use POM methods like `sideMenu.openProducts()` rather than repeating selectors.
- Keep tests **stable** and independent of live data; focus on static texts and components already shown in empty demo state.
- Name tests clearly (e.g. `should_navigate_to_products_page_from_side_menu`).

### 5. Deliverables

1. New/updated Page Objects for Dashboard and SideMenu.
2. New test files for:
   - `dashboard.spec.ts` (all D-series use cases)
   - `navigation.spec.ts` (all N-series use cases)
3. Any necessary updates to test config (tags, fixtures, base URL).
4. Commands I can run, for example:
   - `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Dashboard"` to run dashboard tests only
   - `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Navigation"` to run navigation tests only

Please implement these tests end-to-end in this repo and ensure they pass when run in Replit.
