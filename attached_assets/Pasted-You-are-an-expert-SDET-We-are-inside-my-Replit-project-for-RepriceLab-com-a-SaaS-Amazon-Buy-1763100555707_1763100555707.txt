You are an expert SDET.  
We are inside my Replit project for **RepriceLab.com**, a SaaS Amazon Buy Box repricer (frontend + backend in this repo).

🎯 GOAL  
Create **from scratch** a complete **test automation framework** in this project that covers:

- Frontend UI tests  
- End-to-end (E2E) flows  
- Smoke tests  
- Functional tests  
- Backend/API tests  

Everything must be runnable directly in this Replit project.

---

## Tech & general requirements

1. **Tech stack (proposal)**
   - Use **TypeScript** where possible.
   - **Frontend/E2E/UI:** Playwright (preferred) or Cypress.
   - **Backend/API:** Jest + Supertest (or another standard Node test runner if our backend stack suggests better).
   - Use **Page Object Model (POM)** for UI/E2E tests.

2. **Project structure**

   Create a clean, opinionated structure like:

   - `tests/`
     - `e2e/`          → full end-to-end flows (signup/login, onboarding, dashboard, pricing rules, etc.)
     - `smoke/`        → very fast “is app alive?” checks
     - `functional/`   → detailed UI & business logic tests for important features
     - `api/`          → backend & REST/GraphQL/API tests
     - `utils/`        → shared helpers (test data builders, auth helpers, API clients, etc.)
     - `fixtures/`     → test data, JSON, sample payloads
   - `playwright.config.ts` (or equivalent)  
   - Any config files needed for Jest/API tests.

3. **Environment & config**

   - Add a safe `.env.example` file for test-related env vars (BASE_URL, API_URL, TEST_USER_EMAIL, etc.).
   - Make tests read URLs and credentials from env variables, **never** hard-code secrets.
   - Ensure tests can run:
     - locally on Replit shell (`npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, etc.)
     - headless in CI.

4. **NPM scripts**

   In `package.json`, add scripts like:

   - `"test": "npm run test:smoke"`
   - `"test:smoke"` → run only smoke suite (fast)
   - `"test:e2e"` → run full E2E UI suite
   - `"test:functional"` → functional UI/business tests
   - `"test:api"` → backend/API tests
   - `"test:all"` → everything (api + e2e + functional)

   Use tags or file patterns so I can easily choose which suite to run.

## What to automate (minimum)

### Smoke suite
Very fast checks that tell me the system is basically alive:

- App main page loads without errors.
- Login page renders correctly.
- Can log in with a valid test account and reach dashboard.
- API healthcheck or status endpoint returns success (200).

### E2E flows
Realistic end-to-end journeys, for example:

- **Login flow:** open main page → go to login → enter email/password → reach dashboard → assert dashboard key elements.
- **Signup/onboarding flow** (if implemented): sign up, confirm account, first-login flow.
- **Core repricer flow:** create/edit a repricing rule/profile, save it, see it listed.
- **Forgot password** or any important account recovery flow (if available).

Use Page Objects for major pages:

- `LoginPage`
- `DashboardPage`
- `PricingRulesPage`
- etc.

### Functional UI tests
More detailed tests on important components, such as:

- Form validations (email format, required fields, password rules).
- Error states (wrong password, invalid input).
- Navigation (header links: Features, Pricing, Contact, Login, etc.).
- Visibility of pricing cards, buttons and CTAs.

### Backend/API tests
Create a small but solid API test layer that:

- Hits auth/login endpoint and verifies correct responses.
- Tests main repricing-related endpoints (e.g. create/update rule, list rules, etc.).
- Verifies correct status codes, response schemas, and error handling.

Use a shared **API client helper** to avoid duplication.

## DX (developer experience)

- Add **README or TESTING.md** explaining:
  - How to install dependencies.
  - How to run each suite (smoke, e2e, functional, api, all).
  - How to set up `.env` for tests.
- Make sure default commands work out of the box in Replit terminal with:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run test:smoke`
  - `npm run test:e2e`
  - `npm run test:api`

## Step-by-step execution

Please proceed in clear steps and show me code changes:

1. Inspect the repo and confirm tech stack.
2. Propose the exact tools (Playwright/Cypress, Jest, etc.) and structure based on this stack.
3. Add required dev dependencies and configuration files.
4. Create folder structure and example tests for **each** suite:
   - one smoke test
   - one e2e flow
   - one functional UI test
   - one API test
5. Wire up npm scripts.
6. Run the tests in Replit terminal and fix any issues until they pass.
7. At the end, give me:
   - A short summary of what you created.
   - Concrete commands I should use daily to run:
     - smoke
     - e2e
     - functional
     - backend/api
     - full regression.

Make sure everything you add is inside this Replit project and works end-to-end so I can test both frontend and backend easily.
