Build Admin Dashboard with Kanban Board (Agency Client Portal)

Task Description:
Create an Admin Dashboard page for an agency-style client portal. The page must include a Kanban board with multiple workflow columns, task cards, status indicators, and a left-side admin navigation panel.

✅ Core Requirements
1️⃣ Left Sidebar (Admin Navigation)

Create a fixed left sidebar with the following menu items:

Dashboard

All Requests

Clients

User Management

Analytics

Activity Log

Workload

Settings

Footer section:

Logged-in user avatar

Role label: Agency Admin

2️⃣ Main Content – Kanban Board

Implement a Kanban board with horizontal columns:

Columns (from left to right):

Pending

Active

In Review

Revision

Completed

Each column must:

Display a task count badge

Support vertical scrolling

Have a distinct color theme

3️⃣ Task Cards

Each task card should include:

Task title (e.g. “Mobile App UI Kit”)

Category label (e.g. Web Design, Branding, Development)

Assigned user (avatar or name)

Status badge:

Overdue (red)

Normal (neutral)

Optional priority icon

4️⃣ Status Logic

If task due date < today → show “Overdue” badge

Completed tasks → move to Completed column automatically

Status change should update column placement

5️⃣ Admin Capabilities

Admin should be able to:

Move tasks between columns (drag & drop OR status dropdown)

Assign / reassign tasks to users

Edit task title, category, due date

Mark task as completed

6️⃣ UI / UX Requirements

Dark mode theme (similar to screenshot)

Rounded cards

Smooth hover & transition effects

Clean, modern SaaS look

Responsive layout (desktop-first)

🛠️ Tech Constraints (Replit-friendly)

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

State management: use local state or mock data

No backend required (mock data is OK)

Use reusable components:

Sidebar

KanbanColumn

TaskCard

📦 Deliverables

/AdminDashboard.jsx

/components/Sidebar.jsx

/components/KanbanBoard.jsx

/components/KanbanColumn.jsx

/components/TaskCard.jsx

Mock task data structure

🎯 Goal

Replicate the visual structure and behavior of the provided Kanban admin dashboard and make it suitable for a real agency client portal.
