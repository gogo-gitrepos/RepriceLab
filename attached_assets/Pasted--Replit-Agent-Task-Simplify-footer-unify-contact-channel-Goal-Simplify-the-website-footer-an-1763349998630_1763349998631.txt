🧠 Replit Agent Task – Simplify footer & unify contact channel

Goal:
Simplify the website footer and make sure the only way to contact us is via the “Contact Us” web form (no direct email addresses anywhere).

1. Simplify the footer links

In the main footer component (e.g. Footer.tsx / Footer.jsx in the frontend):

Keep exactly these three columns and links:

Product

Repricing Basics

Pricing Strategies

Integrations

Analytics

Resources

Blog

Help Center

Partners

Company

Contact Us

Affiliates

Requirements:

Remove all other footer links such as “Safe Mode”, “Assisted Setup”, “Customer Stories”, “What’s New”, “eBooks”, “Webinars”, “Careers”, etc.

Keep the current design/style of the footer (layout, colors, typography), just update the link labels and URLs.

Make sure each link points to an existing or placeholder route (e.g. /blog, /help-center, /partners, /affiliates). If a page does not exist yet, link to a sensible placeholder route but do not break the build.

2. Make “Contact Us” the only contact channel

Goal: Nobody should see an email address; everyone must use the Contact Us form.

Ensure the “Contact Us” link in the footer points to the existing contact page with the web form

e.g. route like /contact or /contact-us.

Search the entire codebase for any direct email usage and remove/replace:

All mailto: links (e.g. mailto:support@repricelab.com)

Any visible @repricelab.com email addresses in:

Header / hero sections

Footer

Contact / Support / Help Center pages

FAQ, pricing, about pages

Config files that render emails into the UI

Where an email address was shown to users, replace the text with something like:

“Please use the Contact Us form to get in touch with us.”

Make sure the contact form still works and submits correctly after these changes.

3. Code quality

Do not change backend behavior or email sending logic; only remove emails from the UI.

Keep TypeScript/React/Next.js types and imports clean (no unused imports).

Run the frontend build or dev server to be sure there are no TypeScript/compile errors.
